Amazon Clone Project
Welcome to the Amazon Clone project repository!

Introduction
This project is an Amazon clone that I created during my web development learning phase. It has been an incredible journey that significantly enhanced my HTML and CSS skills. With the help of YouTube tutorials and online resources, I was able to bring this project to life.

Project Overview
The Amazon Clone replicates the look and feel of the original Amazon website. While it doesn't include backend functionality, it serves as an excellent example of front-end development using HTML and CSS. This project includes:

Home Page: A visually appealing landing page with a product showcase.
Navigation Bar: A responsive navigation bar for easy site navigation.
Footer: A comprehensive footer with additional links and information.
